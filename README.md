# @sakuraapi/auth-native-authority

Middleware that adds native (email/password) authentication authority capabilities to a SakuraApi server. An "authentication authority" (in SakuraApi land) is a micro-service / server that is responsible for authentication on behalf of itself and other micro-services. Other SakuraApi micro-services trusting this authority will implement a separate package for consuming the tokens generated by the authentication authority.
